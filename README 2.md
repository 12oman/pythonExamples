IT6033 Data Structure and Algorithm (Q3) Week-1 Session-2
Perform the following programming activities using C# in visual studio. These activities are formulated to refresh the previously learned C# concepts
Task 1:
Given a temperature in Celsius degrees, write a method that converts it to Fahrenheit degrees or vice versa. Remember that temperature below -271.15°C (absolute zero) does not exist!
Expected Input and Output:
Temperature: 5
Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F): F
Conversion to Celsius: -15
Temperature: -300
Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F): C
Note: Temperature below -271.15°C (absolute zero) does not exist on earth!
Task 2:
Given two integers, write a method that returns their multiplication if they are both divisible by 2 or 3, otherwise returns their sum.
Expected input and output
Enter two integers: 15, 30
Divisible By 2 Or 3(15, 30) → 450
Enter two integers: 2, 90
Divisible By 2 Or 3(2, 90) → 180
Enter two integers: 7, 12
Divisible By 2 Or 3(7, 12) → 19
Task 3: Write a program in C# Sharp to take 10 numbers as input from user and find their sum and average.
Task 4: Write a program in C# Sharp to display the multiplication table of a given integer. Expected input and output Input the number (Table to be calculated): 15 Expected Output: 15 X 1 = 15 ... ... 15 X 10 = 150
Task 5:
Write a C# Sharp program to print on screen the output of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of two numbers which will be entered by the user.
Expected input and output
Input the first number: 25 Input the second number: 4 Expected Output: 25 + 4 = 29 25 - 4 = 21 25 x 4 = 100 25 / 4 = 6 25 mod 4 = 1

Task 6: Write a C# Sharp program that takes distance and time as input and displays the speed in kilometers per hour and miles per hour.
Expected input and output
Input distance (meters): 50000 Input time (hour): 1 Input time(minutes): 35 Input time(seconds): 56 Expected Output: Your speed in meters/sec is 8.686588 Your speed in km/h is 31.27172 Your speed in miles/h is 19.4355
Task 7: Write a C# Sharp program that takes the radius of a sphere as input and calculate and display the surface area and volume of the sphere.
Expected input and output
Radius: 2 Expected Output: Surface Area of the Sphere: 50.26548 Volume of the Sphere: 33.51032
